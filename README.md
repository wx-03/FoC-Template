## Friend on Campus (FoC)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)** is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform where
students can request items to be collected from stores or facilities on
campus, and other students can fulfil (and deliver) those requests. The
platform runs on a closed credit economy — credits cannot be bought,
withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a **one-service-per-folder** structure: each
microservice (`user-service/`, `supplier-service/`, `order-service/`,
`credit-service/`) lives in its own top-level folder.

```text
.
├── user-service/
├── supplier-service/
├── order-service/
├── credit-service/
├── <n2h-service>/
└── README.md
```

- Any **nice-to-have (N2H)** feature that warrants its own service should
  be added as an **additional folder** at the same level, following the
  same per-service structure.
- Files for agentic coding tools (e.g. agent configs, prompts, skills)
  may be added as needed, but must still **respect the
  one-service-per-folder skeleton** for core implementation.

## AI Use Summary

**Tools:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5; claude-opus-5 / claude-opus-5-5 for the mockup and order-service scaffolding)
**Prohibited phases avoided:** requirements elicitation; architecture/design decisions.
**Used for:** implementation code, boilerplate/scaffolding, and verification against team-written specifications.
**Verification:** All AI outputs are reviewed, edited, and tested by the authors.
**Prompts / key exchanges:** see [/ai/usage-log.md](ai/usage-log.md) for all services except `foc-mockup/`,
which keeps its own standalone log in [foc-mockup/AI-NOTES.md](foc-mockup/AI-NOTES.md).
