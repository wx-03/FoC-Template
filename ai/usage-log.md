## 2026-09-24 — Stage 1: Project Scaffold

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Set up the user-service scaffold: package.json, .env.example, RS256 keys, .gitignore, tsconfig.json, barebones app.ts, and the src/ directory structure. Then verify with npm install and confirm key files exist. Agreed fixes: run scripts via tsx, add missing @types packages and ESLint flat config, gitignore both keys/ and .env, no dotenv, keep DB_HOST=user-db.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/package.json
- user-service/tsconfig.json
- user-service/eslint.config.js
- user-service/.env.example
- user-service/.gitignore
- user-service/src/app.ts
- user-service/keys/private.pem, user-service/keys/public.pem (generated via openssl)
- user-service/src/{routes,controllers,middleware,services,db/queries,utils}/.gitkeep

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-24 — Stage 2: Database Setup

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Write the Postgres schema (enums + users/users_otps/refresh_tokens tables) in init.sql, a Zod-validated config.ts that exits clearly on missing env vars, and a pool.ts exporting a single pg.Pool sourced from config. Updated app.ts to read port from config instead of process.env.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/db/init.sql
- user-service/src/config.ts
- user-service/src/db/pool.ts
- user-service/src/app.ts (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-24 — Stage 3: Docker Setup

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Build a multi-stage Dockerfile (dev/prod) for user-service, wire up user-db + user-service in the root compose.yaml (healthcheck, init.sql mount, env_file, volume mounts), and create .env from .env.example with a reminder to fill in SMTP. Verified end-to-end with docker compose up --build.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/Dockerfile
- user-service/.dockerignore
- compose.yaml (added user-db, user-service services + user-db-data volume)
- user-service/.env

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 4a: App Setup + Middleware

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Wire up cookie-parser/cors middleware, mount the auth router, and add the shared auth building blocks: sha256 hashing, RS256 JWT verification, Bearer-token authenticate middleware, AppError, asyncHandler, REFRESH_COOKIE_OPTIONS, and the global error handler (AppError/ZodError/malformed-JSON/500 cases). Verified against a temporary protected route + generated test JWTs (valid/expired/wrong-signature) inside Docker, then removed the scaffolding.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/utils/hash.ts
- user-service/src/utils/jwt.ts
- user-service/src/utils/AppError.ts
- user-service/src/utils/asyncHandler.ts
- user-service/src/utils/cookies.ts
- user-service/src/middleware/authenticate.ts
- user-service/src/types/express.d.ts
- user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts
- user-service/src/app.ts (modified)
- user-service/package.json (modified)
- user-service/eslint.config.js (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 4b: Registration

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement user registration: users.queries.ts (CRUD reads + insert), auth.service.ts register() with format/complexity validation and duplicate-username/email handling (both a pre-check and a race-safe unique-constraint catch), and the register controller with a strict Zod schema for presence/type checks. Verified all 12 checklist cases inside Docker, including a concurrent duplicate-registration race test.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/db/queries/users.queries.ts
- user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts
- user-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts
- user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 4c: Login + Tokens

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement login: tokens.queries.ts for refresh token CRUD, a signAccessToken() addition to jwt.ts, auth.service.ts login() (identifier lookup by username/email, bcrypt compare, suspended check, RS256 access token + random refresh token stored as its SHA-256 hash), and the login controller (strict Zod schema, sets the refresh cookie via REFRESH_COOKIE_OPTIONS). Verified all 11 checklist cases inside Docker, including decoding the issued token to confirm claims/algorithm/expiry.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/db/queries/tokens.queries.ts
- user-service/src/utils/jwt.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 4d: Logout + Refresh

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement logout() (revoke by token hash) and refresh() (validate not-found/revoked/expired, re-check current user status so suspension takes effect immediately and role changes propagate on next refresh rather than requiring re-login) in auth.service.ts, plus their controllers and routes (logout behind authenticate). Verified all 10 checklist cases inside Docker, including a live suspend/promote-then-refresh test confirming the new token reflects fresh DB state.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 4e: Inter-Service Verify + Super Admin Bootstrap

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Add GET /auth/verify (reusing verifyAccessToken so it agrees with the authenticate middleware), and a super admin bootstrap that runs on startup: checks for an existing 'super admin' role, creates one from SUPER*ADMIN*_ config (reusing the registration password-complexity regex) if none exists, and is awaited before app.listen(). Added SUPER*ADMIN*_ to config.ts's Zod schema and .env/.env.example. Verified all checklist cases inside Docker, including a container restart to confirm no duplicate bootstrap.

**What it produced:**

- user-service/src/services/bootstrap.service.ts
- user-service/src/config.ts (modified)
- user-service/.env.example (modified)
- user-service/.env (modified)
- user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/db/queries/users.queries.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts (modified)
- user-service/src/app.ts (modified)

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 5a: Schema, Config, Utilities

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement Stage 5a: add 'pending' to status_enum, OTP env vars/config, SMTP optional in development, hashesMatch, generateOtp, withTransaction/Queryable, and user query updates (db param, status param, lockUserById, activateUser, deleteStalePendingUsers).

**What it produced:**
Modified: user-service/src/db/init.sql, src/config.ts, src/utils/hash.ts, src/db/queries/users.queries.ts, src/services/auth.service.ts, .env.example
Created: src/utils/otp.ts, src/utils/otp.test.ts, src/db/transaction.ts

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 5b: Email Service

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement Stage 5b: Nodemailer-based sendOtpEmail with purpose map, text+html bodies, throw on failure, and a development-only console fallback when SMTP_HOST is empty.

**What it produced:**
Created: user-service/src/services/email.service.ts

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I kept all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 5c: OTP Queries + Service

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement Stage 5c: otp.queries.ts (create/invalidate/findLatest/count/increment/consume), otp.service.ts (issueOtp, checkOtp returning {ok:false} instead of throwing on mismatch), plus Vitest tests for checkOtp branching.

**What it produced:**
Created: user-service/src/db/queries/otp.queries.ts, src/services/otp.service.ts, src/services/otp.service.test.ts

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I kept all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 5d: Registration Now Creates a Pending Account

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement Stage 5d: transactional register (delete stale pending users, duplicate checks, create pending user, issue OTP), register returns 201 OTP_SENT, login rejects pending accounts with 403 ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED after the credential check.

**What it produced:**
Modified: user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts, src/controllers/auth.controller.ts

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I kept all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 5e: Verify OTP + Resend OTP Endpoints

**Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-5)
**Scope:** Implementation code

**What I prompted:**
Implement Stage 5e: public POST /auth/verify-otp and /auth/resend-otp with strict Zod validation, verifyRegistrationOtp/resendRegistrationOtp in the service layer (row lock, attempt persistence, resend limit and cooldown), and Retry-After support via AppError.retryAfterSeconds.

**What it produced:**
Modified: user-service/src/utils/AppError.ts, src/app.ts, src/routes/auth.routes.ts, src/services/auth.service.ts, src/controllers/auth.controller.ts

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #1: OTP resend window config

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** explain, generate
**Scope:** Implementation code, Boilerplate
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 1 (specified in Stage 5a: "Update `.env.example` and `.env`", "Update `src/config.ts`")

**Prompts (exact):**

> read thru the code base and instructions.md and understand what's going on. don't start coding first.

> okay let's work on the Changes to already-implemented code (do these first). do them one by one and let me know what you did after each one before asking for permission to proceed. the one that's under stage 6.

**Key responses:**
Read `instructions.md` and the `user-service` source, and summarised the codebase and where it differs from the instructions (no code changes in that turn). Then implemented row 1 only: added `OTP_RESEND_WINDOW_MINUTES=60` to the env files, added it to the Zod schema in `config.ts` (coerced positive integer), and exposed it as `config.otp.resendWindowMinutes`. `npx tsc --noEmit` reported one error in `users.queries.ts` (`createSuperAdmin` return type), which was already present and was not changed. The app was not run, so startup behaviour is unverified. Rows 2–9 are not done yet.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/config.ts` (modified)
- `user-service/.env.example` (modified; no header added)
- `user-service/.env` (modified; gitignored, no header)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
Pre-existing typecheck error at `users.queries.ts:105` (`createSuperAdmin` returns `UserRow | null` but is typed `Promise<UserRow>`); left unchanged pending a decision.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Had to merge in the changes in a PR for the questions, but accepted everything else.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #2: Windowed countOtps

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 2 (specified in Stage 5c, `countOtps`)

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's go with 2.

**Key responses:**
Added an optional `sinceMinutes` parameter to `countOtps` in `otp.queries.ts`. Without it the query is unchanged and counts all rows (registration, as before). With it, the query counts only rows where `created_at > clock_timestamp() - make_interval(mins => $3)`. The only existing caller (`resendRegistrationOtp`) does not pass it, so registration behaviour is unchanged. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors (the `createSuperAdmin` error noted in the previous entry no longer appears; I did not change that file). The query was not run against a database, so it is unverified at runtime.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/db/queries/otp.queries.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
None

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
I accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #3: checkOtp consume flag

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 3 (specified in Stage 6a)

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's do 3.

**Key responses:**
Added an optional third parameter `consume: boolean = true` to `checkOtp` in `otp.service.ts`. When `false`, a correct guess returns `{ ok: true }` without calling `consumeOtp`. A wrong guess still increments attempts and returns `{ ok: false }` regardless of the flag. The expiry, attempts-exceeded and missing/consumed-OTP checks are unchanged. The only existing caller (`verifyRegistrationOtp`) does not pass the argument, so registration behaviour is unchanged. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. The `consume: false` path is not exercised yet (no caller until Stage 6c), so it is unverified at runtime.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/services/otp.service.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
None

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-28 — order-service: Prisma Order Seed Fixtures

**Tool:** GitHub Copilot (model: GPT-5.6 Luna)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Boilerplate
**Governing decision:** Existing `order-service/prisma/schema.prisma` model and `order-service/AGENTS.md` implementation-only rules.

**Prompts (exact):**

> help me create a seed.ts inside prisma/ with dummy data of orders for testing. include multiple orders of different statuses and different locations and different numbers of credits offered.

**Key responses:**
Added `order-service/prisma/seed.ts` with nine deterministic order fixtures covering all seven request statuses, varied campus locations, and credit amounts from 2 to 15. The script deletes only those fixed fixture IDs before inserting, loads `DATABASE_URL` through dotenv, uses the existing Prisma PostgreSQL adapter, and disconnects in a `finally` block. Focused TypeScript validation passed with the service's installed compiler; no database seed run was performed.

**Files:**

- `order-service/prisma/seed.ts` (created)
- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified: Log index row)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
None

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #4: Forgot Password email template

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 4 (specified in Stage 6a, "Update `src/services/email.service.ts`")

**Prompts (exact):**

> yes let's do 4

**Key responses:**
Added a `Forgot Password` entry to the `PURPOSE_COPY` map in `email.service.ts` with subject "Your FoC password reset code", as specified. The instructions give no intro text, so the AI wrote the one-line intro "Use the code below to reset your FoC password." in the same shape as the registration one; the body still contains the OTP and the expiry from `config.otp.ttlMinutes`, with no links. The dev-log fallback is unchanged. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. No email was sent, so the template is unverified.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/services/email.service.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
The intro sentence wording was not specified in `instructions.md`; the AI supplied it. The team may want to reword it.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Okay with the wording used.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #6: Login race-safety

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate, refactor
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 6 (specified in Stage 4c, "Race-safety" bullet)

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's skip 5 first. what's 6?

> yes let's do 6

**Key responses:**
Changed `login` in `auth.service.ts` so the refresh token is created inside `withTransaction` after locking the user row. The password is still verified before the lock. Inside the transaction: `lockUserById(user.id, client)`; if the locked row is null or its `password_hash` differs from the earlier read, throw `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; if it is `suspended`, throw `403 ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED`; otherwise `createRefreshToken(..., client)`. The role for the access token and the response comes from the locked row, and the access token is signed after the transaction commits. The pending check and its order (401, then pending 403, then suspended 403) are unchanged. The unused `Date.now()`-based `expiresAt` variable had already been removed from the file before this change. Change #5 was deliberately skipped for now (to be done with 6c/6e, since it needs service functions that do not exist yet). `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. The race itself (login concurrent with reset or suspend) was not exercised, so it is unverified at runtime.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
Change #5 skipped for now at the user's request; because it has dependencies in Stage 6.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #7: Registration resend-limit message

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 7 (specified in Stage 5e, `resendRegistrationOtp` step 3)

**Prompts (exact):**

> yes do 7

**Key responses:**
Changed the `OTP_RESEND_LIMIT` message in `resendRegistrationOtp` (`auth.service.ts`) from "Maximum OTP resends reached. Please register again later." to "Maximum OTP resends reached. Please try registering again in about 10 minutes.", as specified. Only the text changed; the status code, error code and limit logic are unchanged. The 10 minutes is hard-coded in the message and matches `OTP_TTL_MINUTES=10`, as `instructions.md` notes it must be updated by hand if that value changes. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. The endpoint was not called, so the message is unverified at runtime.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
None

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #8: Locked refresh

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate, refactor
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 8 (specified in Stage 4d, `refresh` and the lock ordering rule)

**Prompts (exact):**

> 8 now! also, for all the prev parts, the header should say pre-work for 6

**Key responses:**
Renamed the header entries added for changes #1–#4, #6 and #7 from "Stage 6 - ..." to "Stage 6 pre-work - ..." in `config.ts`, `otp.queries.ts`, `otp.service.ts`, `email.service.ts` and `auth.service.ts`. Then implemented #8. `lockRefreshToken` in `tokens.queries.ts` now selects `clock_timestamp() AS db_now` and returns `RefreshTokenRowWithNow`; `logout`, its only other caller, is unaffected. `refresh` in `auth.service.ts` keeps its plain early-exit read (not found, revoked or expired against `db_now` gives `401 INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN`), then runs `withTransaction`: lock the user row first (null gives 401), then the token row via `lockRefreshToken`, and re-check revoked or expired on the locked token (401). It then throws `403 ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` if the locked user is suspended, and otherwise issues the access token from the locked user's id and role. The existing expiry comparison (`expires_at < db_now`) was kept as is. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. The lock behaviour (refresh concurrent with logout, reset or suspend, and the no-deadlock check in Stage 4d verification) was not exercised, so it is unverified at runtime.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/db/queries/tokens.queries.ts` (modified)
- `user-service/src/services/auth.service.ts` (modified)
- `user-service/src/config.ts` (modified, header text only)

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6 pre-work #9: Logout route without authenticate

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** refactor
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code", row 9 (specified in Stage 4d, "Update `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`")

**Prompts (exact):**

> 9 now

**Key responses:**
Changed the logout route in `auth.routes.ts` to `router.post('/logout', authController.logout)`, so logout depends only on the refresh cookie and still works with an expired access token. Also removed the now-unused `authenticate` import from that file (not listed in the instructions, done to avoid an unused-import warning). The `authenticate` middleware file itself is untouched and has no consumers until `GET /users/me` (Stage 7). The controller already reads the refresh cookie, so nothing else changed. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. The route was not called, so the behaviour is unverified at runtime. Change #5 remains skipped and is planned to be done with Stages 6c/6e.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
Removed the unused `authenticate` import in `auth.routes.ts`, which the instructions did not explicitly list.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6a: requestOtp

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6a, "Add `requestOtp` to `src/services/otp.service.ts`"

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's do 6a

**Key responses:**
Stage 6a has three parts. The `consume` flag on `checkOtp` and the `Forgot Password` email template were already done as pre-work #3 and #4, so this entry covers only `requestOtp`, added to `otp.service.ts` and exported with a `RequestOtpResult` type. It must run inside `withTransaction` and does the following in order: lock the user (`lockUserById`; null returns `no-user`, `pending` returns `not-verified`); count OTPs in the rolling window (`countOtps` with `config.otp.resendWindowMinutes`), returning `throttled` with reason `limit` when `count - 1 >= maxResends`; check the cooldown against `db_now` from `findLatestOtp`, returning `throttled` with reason `cooldown` and `retryAfterSeconds` (rounded up); otherwise call `issueOtp` and return `sent`. `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` from `issueOtp` propagates unchanged. When throttled, nothing is sent and the existing OTP is not invalidated. There is no caller yet (forgot-password arrives in 6b), so `requestOtp` is unexercised. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. Not verified at runtime: throttled paths, no email sent when throttled, and the previous OTP staying valid.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/services/otp.service.ts` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
None. The interrupted first request produced no changes; the work was done on the repeated prompt.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6b: POST /auth/forgot-password

**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6b (design decisions in Stage 6 header; `requestOtp` from Stage 6a)

**Prompts (exact):**

> yes

(Reply to: "Shall I create `feat/stage-6b-forgot-password` from `main` and start 6b?")

**Key responses:**
Added `forgotPassword({ email })` to `auth.service.ts`, inside `withTransaction`: `findByEmail` (none gives `404 EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`, `pending` gives `403 ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED` as early exits), then `requestOtp` with purpose `Forgot Password`, mapping its result: `sent` returns; `throttled` with `cooldown` gives `429 OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN` with `retryAfterSeconds`; `throttled` with `limit` gives `429 OTP_RESEND_LIMIT` ("try again in about an hour"); `no-user` gives `404`; `not-verified` gives `403`. `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` propagates as `503`. Added a `forgotPassword` controller with a strict Zod schema using the shared `emailField` (returns `200 OTP_SENT`, "A reset code has been sent to your email") and the route `POST /auth/forgot-password`. The `forgot_password` purpose in `verify-otp`/`resend-otp` (pre-work #5) was not touched. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. Ran against the dev containers (`docker compose up` of user-db and user-service): unknown email gave 404; a registered email gave 200 and one `Forgot Password` OTP row; an immediate repeat gave 429 with `Retry-After: 60`; an extra field gave 400 "Request contains unexpected fields"; a missing email gave 400 "Email is required"; with the cooldown backdated, three concurrent requests gave one 200 and two 429, leaving one active OTP row. Not run: the resend-limit path, the pending-account path, the email-send-failure path (503) and the wrong-type email path. These OTP rows were created for the bootstrap super admin account in the dev database.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6c: verify-otp for forgot_password (includes pre-work #5, verify-otp half)

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6c, and Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code" row 5 (verify-otp half only)

**Prompts (exact):**

> go ahead. do all these and start with 6c

(Reply to the 6b hand-off: "Once you've reviewed and edited whatever you want, tell me to go ahead. I'll commit as `feat: implement forgot password endpoint (stage 6b)`, push, and open the PR. Then I'll check out `main`, pull, and branch for 6c." The 6b work was committed, pushed and opened as PR #83, then this work was started on a new branch from `main`.)

**Key responses:**
In `auth.controller.ts`: added `forgot_password` to `PURPOSE_MAP` (`'Forgot Password'`), split the shared purpose schema into `verifyPurposeSchema` (`registration`, `forgot_password`) and `resendPurposeSchema` (`registration` only), both using one shared error map ("Invalid purpose" / "Purpose is required" / "Purpose must be a string"), and made the `verifyOtp` dispatch return per purpose: registration keeps `REGISTER_SUCCESS`, `Forgot Password` calls `authService.verifyForgotPasswordOtp` and returns `200 { message: 'Code verified. You can now set a new password.', code: 'OTP_VERIFIED' }`. The purpose schema was split so `resend-otp` does not accept `forgot_password` before its service function exists (Stage 6e); otherwise it would fall through the switch and return a false success. This means row 5 is only half done: the `resend-otp` enum and dispatch are still to do in 6e. In `auth.service.ts`: added `verifyForgotPasswordOtp({ email, otp })`. It checks the OTP format (400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`), then inside `withTransaction`: `findByEmail` (none gives `404 EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`, `pending` gives `403 ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED`), `lockUserById` with the same two re-checks after the lock (suspended accounts allowed), then `checkOtp(..., consume = false)`. A wrong guess returns `{ ok: false }`, and `INVALID_OTP` is thrown only after commit so the attempt increment persists. `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src` pass. This branch was cut from `main`, so the 6b `forgot-password` endpoint (PR #83) is not on it; a `Forgot Password` OTP row for the bootstrap super admin (known code) was inserted directly in the dev database and the endpoint was tested against the running container: correct code gave 200 and left `consumed_at` NULL; re-submitting gave 200 again; a wrong code gave 400 with `attempts_count` persisted at 1; after 5 wrong codes the correct code gave 429 `OTP_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED`; an expired OTP gave 400 `OTP_EXPIRED`; an unknown email gave 404; a pending account's email gave 403; `purpose: "forgot password"` gave 400 "Invalid purpose"; a 5-digit OTP gave 400 "OTP must be a 6-digit code"; `resend-otp` with `forgot_password` gave 400 "Invalid purpose"; `registration` verify still works (returned INVALID_OTP for a non-pending user). Not run: the case of a suspended account, and concurrent verifies.

## 2026-09-25 — Stage 6d: POST /auth/reset-password

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6d (and the lock ordering rule in Stage 4d)

**Prompts (exact):**

> good to go, let's go on to the next part

(Reply to the 6c hand-off asking the user to review before committing. The 6c work was then committed, pushed and opened as PR #84, and this work was started on a new branch from `main`.)

**Key responses:**
Added `revokeAllRefreshTokensForUser(userId, db)` to `tokens.queries.ts` (sets `is_revoked` and `revoked_at` on the user's non-revoked tokens) and `updatePasswordHash(userId, passwordHash, db)` to `users.queries.ts` (also sets `updated_at`). Added `resetPassword({ email, otp, newPassword })` to `auth.service.ts`: validates `newPassword` complexity with the registration message and `otp` as 6 digits (400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`), then inside `withTransaction`: `findByEmail` (none gives `404 EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`, `pending` gives `403 ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED`), `lockUserById` with the same re-checks after the lock (suspended allowed), then the default consuming `checkOtp` for `Forgot Password`; on `{ ok: true }` it bcrypt-hashes the new password (work factor 10), updates the hash, and revokes all the user's refresh tokens, all in the same transaction (user row locked first, per the lock order rule). `INVALID_OTP` is thrown only after commit so wrong-guess attempts persist. To reuse the registration password message without duplicating the string, it was moved into a `PASSWORD_MESSAGE` constant that `register` now also uses (text unchanged; small refactor beyond the spec). Added the `resetPassword` controller (strict Zod schema with the shared `emailField`; messages "OTP is required", "OTP must be a string", "New password is required", "New password must be a string"; returns `200 PASSWORD_RESET_SUCCESS`) and the route `POST /auth/reset-password`. `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src` pass. Tested against the dev containers with a freshly registered user (register, verify, login, forgot-password, reset): weak password gave 400 with the standard message; missing `newPassword` gave 400 "New password is required"; an extra field gave 400 "Request contains unexpected fields"; a 2-digit OTP gave 400 "OTP must be a 6-digit code"; a wrong OTP gave 400 `INVALID_OTP` with `attempts_count` persisted at 1; an unknown email gave 404; two concurrent resets with the correct OTP gave one 200 and one 400 `INVALID_OTP`; after the reset the user had 0 non-revoked refresh tokens (the pre-reset token was revoked and the old cookie's refresh gave 401); login with the new password gave 200 and with the old password 401; re-using the consumed OTP gave 400 `INVALID_OTP`. My first two test runs failed because of mistakes in my test script (the service was mid-restart, then a wrong log-grep pattern), not because of the code, and were rerun. Not run: 5 wrong OTPs then the correct one, an expired OTP, a pending account on this endpoint, a suspended account, and the login-loop-versus-reset race.

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
Extracted the registration password message into a `PASSWORD_MESSAGE` constant (text unchanged) so `resetPassword` reuses it; this touches `register`, which the spec did not mention.

The 6d branch was cut from a `main` that did not yet contain PR #84 (6c), so before pushing, `origin/main` was merged into it (user asked for this). The merge conflicted at the end of `auth.service.ts`, `auth.controller.ts`, `ai/usage-log.md` and `README.md`; the log and README were resolved by keeping both sides. Separately, `origin/main` itself did not typecheck after PR #84: the earlier "Merge branch 'main' into feat/stage-6c..." auto-merge had interleaved the end-of-file `forgotPassword` (6b) and `verifyForgotPasswordOtp` (6c) functions (`tsc` error TS1128 in `auth.service.ts`). While resolving this merge the AI restored those two functions from their own commits (`f797583`, `cda9a47`) and kept `resetPassword` after them, so this branch's `auth.service.ts` also carries that repair. After the merge `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src` pass, and forgot-password, verify-otp (`forgot_password`), reset-password, login with the new and old passwords, and re-use of the consumed OTP were re-run against the containers with the expected results.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-26 — Stage 6e: resend-otp for forgot_password (includes pre-work #5, resend-otp half)

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md`, Stage 6e, and Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code" row 5 (resend-otp half; the verify-otp half was done in 6c)

**Prompts (exact):**

> okay, can proceed with 6e

(After PR #85 for 6d was merged into `main`, this work was started on a new branch from an updated `main`, as the user had asked.)

**Key responses:**
In `auth.controller.ts`: `resendPurposeSchema` now accepts `registration` and `forgot_password`, and `resendOtp` dispatches `'Forgot Password'` to `authService.resendForgotPasswordOtp`; the stale comment saying resend-otp does not accept `forgot_password` was removed. `PURPOSE_MAP` already contained the mapping from 6c. In `auth.service.ts`: added `resendForgotPasswordOtp({ email })`, which calls `forgotPassword` (same operation, implemented once, per the spec), so both endpoints share the `requestOtp` lock, cooldown, rolling-window limit and error mapping. The success response for resend keeps the existing body (`200 { message: 'A new verification code has been sent to your email', code: 'OTP_SENT' }`). This completes pre-work #5. `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src` pass. Tested against the dev containers with a fresh user: a resend before verifying registration gave 403 `ACCOUNT_NOT_VERIFIED` and no `Forgot Password` row; after `forgot-password`, an immediate resend gave 429 `OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN` with `Retry-After: 60`; with the cooldown backdated a resend gave 200 and left one active OTP row (previous consumed); after 5 successful resends (6 rows) the next gave 429 `OTP_RESEND_LIMIT` ("try again in about an hour") with no new row; after ageing all rows past the window a resend gave 200 (limit not permanent); an unknown email gave 404 with no row created; an extra field, a non-string email and `purpose: "forgot password"` each gave 400 with the expected message; a suspended account's resend gave 200; a pending account's `forgot_password` resend gave 403 with no row; and the registration resend still gave its cooldown 429. Not run: the email-send-failure 503 path, and concurrent resends for this purpose.

## 2026-09-26 — Docs: align instructions.md with the codebase

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** docs
**Scope:** Refactor/Docs
**Governing decision:** Code in `user-service/` as of Stage 6e; user-approved edits listed under Key responses

**Prompts (exact):**

**Key responses:**
Compared `instructions.md` with the user-service source (read only; the app and tests were not run). Proposed three text edits and applied them after approval: (1) the Stage 1 `package.json` block now matches the real scripts and dependency versions; (2) removed the stale sentence in Stage 5e saying the registration resend message still needed changing; (3) added a status note above the Stage 6 "Changes to already-implemented code" table saying all nine changes are implemented. No requirements, design or schema content was changed. Stage 7 was noted as not yet written down and was not drafted.

**Files:**

- `instructions.md` (modified; no header added, as it is a team-owned document)
- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
Stage 7 (`GET /users/me` and later) is not in `instructions.md`; the team needs to write it before it can be implemented.

## 2026-09-26 — Stage 7: Comprehensive Test Suite (Stages 1-6)

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 7: Comprehensive Test Suite" including the team's answers to the ambiguity list (Test stack, Infrastructure, Mocking policy, Manual-only verification bullets, Temporary protected route, Concurrency test parameters), plus the Verification bullets of Stages 1-6

**Prompts (exact):**

> give me any questions you have before starting stag 7

> 1. for traceability table, you can just wait until we're done with all the testing, then ask me about it again. for ambiguity list, this is the ambiguity check!

> 1. okay feel free to make these changes
> 2. let's go with (a). for this (and for any other changes you make that affect deployment later), include a note in instructions.md to reverse those changes later on.

**Key responses:**
Produced the ambiguity list before writing any tests and waited for the team's answers. Then implemented the decided setup: split `app.ts` into a pure `app` export plus `server.ts` (bootstrap, then listen) and updated the `start`/`dev` scripts and the prod `CMD`; published `user-db` on host port 5434 (temporary, with a reverse-before-deploy note in `instructions.md`); added `vitest.config.ts` (sequential files), a global setup that drops and recreates `user_service_test` from `init.sql`, per-file setup (`.env.test`, throwaway RS256 keys, mocked `sendOtpEmail`), and SQL/email/fixture helpers. Wrote 407 tests in 15 files under `user-service/tests/`, mirroring `src/`, with a separate `concurrency/` folder. Deterministic lock-interleaving tests hold a row lock, start the request, change state, then commit. No application logic was changed and no test asserts deferred features (NFR1, NFR2, rate limiting). Traceability table not written yet, as instructed.
Verification actually run: the full suite (407 passed), `eslint .` and `tsc --noEmit` for the tests were clean. Docker was not running, so the suite ran against a temporary local PostgreSQL 14 on port 5434, not the project's Postgres 16 container. Mutation check: temporarily removing `SKIP LOCKED`, the revoke-all in reset-password, and the login post-lock password re-check each made tests fail; the source was restored afterwards. `npm run build`, the Docker build, and `docker compose up` were not run.
Committed separately on `main` at the user's request: the user's own `instructions.md` edits.

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- The Stage 7 "co-locate tests next to the source" bullet conflicts with the team's answer to keep tests in `user-service/tests/`; the answer was followed, with a tree mirroring `src/`.
- Stage 4b describes register returning `201 REGISTER_SUCCESS`; tests assert the current `201 OTP_SENT` from Stage 5d.
- Traceability table (`tests/TRACEABILITY.md`) is still to be written; the team asked to be asked again once testing is done.
- The temporary `5434:5432` port mapping in `compose.yaml` must be removed before deployment (see `instructions.md`).

## 2026-09-26 — Recess iteration: Credit Service schema, allocation and reservation

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Requirements formatting | Implementation code | Boilerplate
**Governing decision:** `credit-service/credit-service-context.md` §3 (service boundaries), §4 (stack), §5 (schema decisions), §6 (F19, F20), §7 (NFR8), §8 (API surface); `docs/FoC-ProductBacklog.md` (reference only — the team directed that the context file takes precedence); schema conventions follow the team's existing `user-service/src/db/init.sql`.

**Prompts (exact):**

> Read credit-service/CONTEXT.md, paying special attention to §10 regarding the ordering problems. I agree with the flagged gaps. Please officially move F20.1.1 (logging) to the current Recess iteration, and move NFR8.1.2 (rollback) to Week 7 so it is built alongside F19.3 (transfer).
>
> With that updated plan, begin implementing the Recess iteration tasks (F19.1 and F19.2). Start by creating the PostgreSQL schema for both the balances and transaction_log tables. Ensure that all credit operations (like allocation and reservation) are wrapped in atomic database transactions that write to both tables simultaneously, fulfilling NFR8.1.1 and F20.1.1 from the start.
>
> make sure to summarise what you have change after every iteration of prompt. You are now to write all the credit service related files in credit-service folder, MAKE SURE to ask for my permission before you touch any code outside of this folder

> u can edit 1 2 and 4, for the productbacklog, you can just treat that as reference and just follow the credit service context file

Answers given to five questions the agent stopped to ask (see "Deviations" below):

> Destination = new user
>
> ai/usage-log.md + README row, docs/FoC-ProductBacklog.md, compose.yaml + .env.example, for the productbacklog make sure to ask my permission everytime you change, same goes for the other 2
>
> Unique index per request
>
> Follow user-service conventions
>
> TypeScript + vitest

**Key responses:**
Stopped before writing any SQL and asked five questions, because `AGENTS.md` §2.1 lists schema, interface and dependency choices as stop-and-ask triggers. The blocking one: F20.1.1 says originating user is "not applicable for allocation" and destination user is "applicable to transfer only", so an allocation row would name nobody and F19.5.2 could never return a user's own allocation. The team chose destination = the new user.

Recorded the team's two iteration moves in `credit-service-context.md` (F20.1.1 → Recess in §6, NFR8.1.2 → week 7 in §7, §10 gaps 1 and 2 struck through and marked resolved with the date). No rationale was written for either move; `AGENTS.md` §2 prohibits the agent drafting decision rationales. The backlog was left untouched at the team's instruction, so `docs/FoC-ProductBacklog.md` lines 216 and 274 still read week 9 and week 8 and now disagree with the context file by design.

Wrote the schema in `src/db/init.sql`: `balances` (user_id PK, total_balance, reserved_balance, timestamps, CHECK constraints for non-negative values and reserved <= total) and `transaction_log` (the seven F20.1.1 fields, CHECK constraints fixing which party columns each transaction type fills and requiring request_id on everything except allocation). Partial unique indexes enforce one transfer per request (F19.3.2, placed early) and one reservation per request (team decision this session). No FK on user_id, per §3. NFR8.2.3's `REVOKE` is deliberately left inert and documented, because the sibling services connect as the `postgres` superuser, which bypasses REVOKE entirely; it is a week 7 item.

Implemented F19.1.1 and F19.2.1–F19.2.3. Both write paths run inside one `withTransaction` (helper copied from `user-service/src/db/transaction.ts`), issuing the balance write and the `transaction_log` insert on the same client, so NFR8.1.1 and F20.1.1 hold from the first commit. Reservation takes `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the balance row before comparing the offer against unreserved. Allocation uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`, so a repeated registration trigger is resolved by the primary key rather than by a check-then-write race, and writes no second log row.

Verification actually run: `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0. **The test suite was not run and the SQL has never been executed by a server** — the Docker daemon was not running, nothing was listening on ports 5432–5435, and `psql` is not installed, so no database was reachable. `tests/services/credits.service.test.ts` and `tests/concurrency/reserve.concurrency.test.ts` are written but unproven.

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- **F20.1.1 contradicts itself on allocation.** Read literally, an allocation row names no user. Team answered: destination = the new user. Encoded in the `transaction_log_party_shape` CHECK constraint.
- **The API contract is not team-decided.** §8 fixes only method and path. The request bodies, response bodies and all seven status codes were written by the agent to make the service runnable and are tabulated in `credit-service/README.md` under "pending team sign-off". `AGENTS.md` §2.1 classifies these as team decisions.
- **NFR8.2.3 is not enforced.** Needs a named least-privilege application role; the current superuser connection would ignore `REVOKE`. Week 7.
- **F20.1 (parent) still reads week 9** in §6 while its only child F20.1.1 now reads Recess. Not changed without instruction.
- **Duplicate reservation protection is not in any requirement.** The team added a unique index this session; no FR covers it.
- **The backlog and the context file now disagree** on F20.1.1 and NFR8.1.2, by the team's instruction.
- Tests were written but never executed; see Key responses.

## 2026-09-28 — frontend: Fix localhost connection after Compose target switch

**Tool:** GitHub Copilot
**Mode:** debug, refactor, docs
**Scope:** Debugging, Boilerplate, Refactor/Docs
**Governing decision:** Existing frontend Compose setup and the user's localhost error report.

**Prompts (exact):**

**Key responses:**
Diagnosed that the running `foc-frontend` container was the development Vite image without a host port mapping, while production Compose expected nginx on `5173:80`. Rebuilt and recreated the production frontend, confirmed nginx was running, and added a distinct `foc-frontend-dev` image tag to the dev override to prevent dev/production image reuse. Frontend HTTP returned 200; the order database and order service remained healthy.

## 2026-09-26 — Recess iteration: Credit Service verification run

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-opus-5)
**Mode:** debug | docs
**Scope:** Implementation code | Debugging | Requirements formatting
**Governing decision:** `credit-service/credit-service-context.md` §6 (F19, F20), §7 (NFR8.1.1); team answers given in chat on 2026-09-26.

**Prompts (exact):**

> 1. this can be put on hold
> 2. move f20.1 to recess week
> 3. It's right to have left it unenforced.
> 4. remind me later
>
> Both user_id and request_id are confirmed by the team to be UUIDs.
>
> Please write the `credit-db` service for `compose.yaml` and `.env.example`.
>
> - Check the host ports mapped to `user-db` and `order-db` and pick the next free port.
> - Match their patterns exactly (Postgres image/tag, volume naming, healthchecks).
> - Ensure `init.sql` is mounted exactly how the sibling services do it.

> "Please fold it into the next substantive entry. We don't need a separate log for this minor documentation update.
> With the Docker compose file confirmed, please proceed with spinning up the database container (`docker compose up -d credit-db`) and running the test suite to verify the Recess iteration logic. Report the results of the concurrency test."

**Key responses:**

**Corrects the previous entry.** The entry above this one states "The test suite was not run and the SQL has never been executed by a server". That was true when written and is no longer true. Entries are append-only (`AGENTS.md` §5.1), so this entry records the verification rather than editing that one.

Folded in from the intervening exchange: F20.1 moved from week 9 to Recess in `credit-service-context.md` §6, so parent and child now agree (F20.1.1 had already moved). The team confirmed `user_id` and `request_id` as UUIDs — already implemented that way in `init.sql` and validated with `z.string().uuid()`, so no code changed. The team confirmed leaving NFR8.2.3 unenforced was correct, and put the API contract sign-off on hold.

The `credit-db` compose service requested in the prompt had already been written in the previous task, so it was verified rather than rewritten: host port 5435 is the next free one after order-db 5433 and user-db 5434; volume `credit-db-data` matches the `*-db-data` naming and is declared in the top-level `volumes:` block; the healthcheck is byte-identical to order-db's; `init.sql` is mounted exactly as user-db mounts its own. Two points where the siblings disagree were flagged rather than silently resolved: the Postgres tag (order-db `postgres:17` vs user-db `postgres:16-alpine` — used 16-alpine, matching user-service) and the port style (used order-db's env-driven form rather than user-db's hardcoded one, which carries a remove-before-deploy note).

Verification actually run, against a real database this time. Docker Desktop was not running and was started. `docker compose up -d credit-db` created the container; the Postgres image applied `src/db/init.sql` on first start, producing both tables and all five indexes, and the container reported healthy. `npm test` passed 10 tests in 2 files. `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` exit 0.

Concurrency results (NFR8.1.1): six simultaneous 4-credit reservations against a 20-credit balance left exactly five committed and one rejected with `INSUFFICIENT_UNRESERVED_CREDITS`, final state `reserved=20, total=20` with six log rows; ten concurrent 3-credit reservations kept `reserved` equal to three times the number of logged reservations; two simultaneous allocations for one user produced one success and one log row.

Mutation check, to show the concurrency test is not vacuous: removing `FOR UPDATE` from `lockBalanceForUpdate` made the first concurrency test fail, and the failure was informative. All six requests passed the application-level comparison because without the lock they all read `reserved_balance = 0`; the sixth was stopped by the `balances_reserved_not_exceeding_total` CHECK constraint (SQLSTATE 23514) rather than by the service. So the row lock is what produces a clean 422, and the CHECK constraint is what prevents balance corruption if the lock is ever lost. The source was restored and the suite re-run green.

NFR8.2.3 was confirmed still unenforced by deleting a `transaction_log` row while connected as the `credit` application role. Expected; it is a week 7 item.

Tests clean up after themselves — both tables were empty afterwards.

Note for whoever runs this next: the Docker environment was later found to be completely empty (no containers, volumes or images), consistent with a Docker Desktop reset rather than any command run here. Re-running `docker compose up -d credit-db` recreates everything from `init.sql`.

- `credit-service/tests/setup/env.ts` (created)
- `credit-service/vitest.config.ts` (modified: setupFiles)

- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- The previous entry's verification statement is now out of date; corrected here rather than edited, per the append-only rule.
- Postgres tag and port style: the two sibling databases disagree, so "match their patterns exactly" had no single answer. Choices recorded above; switching `credit-db` to `postgres:17` is a one-line change if the team prefers order-db's tag.
- Still open and unchanged: the API contract (request/response bodies and status codes) is agent-written and on hold; NFR8.2.3 needs a named least-privilege role in week 7; author review signatures are outstanding on every credit-service file header and on both log entries.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 8: RBAC Middleware

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 8: RBAC Middleware" (design decisions table, `src/middleware/authorize.ts` spec, Verification bullets, and the "Tests (Vitest)" section).

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's go with stage 8. here's the workflow:
>
> 1. before starting the stage, make sure you go to main and pull from it.
> 2. branch from main to a branch called (e.g. feat/stage-8a-name)
> 3. complete the changes.
> 4. fill in the AI declaration in usage-log.md (follow the format for the last few ones) and the AI header in individual files.
> 5. wait for further instructions.
> 6. once i approve, you can do git add, commit (feat: implement ...(stage 8a)), push the branch and PR

**Key responses:**
Pulled `main` (already up to date) and branched to `feat/stage-8-rbac-middleware`. Created `authorize(minimumRole)`, a middleware factory in `user-service/src/middleware/authorize.ts`, with the exported `ROLE_RANK` table (`user` 0, `admin` 1, `super admin` 2). The returned middleware responds `401 { message: 'Unauthorized', code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' }` when `req.user` is missing (same shape as `authenticate`), calls `next()` when the caller's rank is at least the minimum, and otherwise responds `403 { message: 'Forbidden', code: 'FORBIDDEN' }`. It is synchronous, does no DB work and does not use `asyncHandler`. Nothing is wired onto a route (Stages 9-10 do that) and there are no DB changes.

One point the spec does not state: a role name missing from `ROLE_RANK` (on the caller or as `minimumRole`) makes the comparison false, so the request gets `403`. This is a side effect of the specified comparison, not an added rule.

Wrote `tests/middleware/authorize.test.ts` (9 tests, fake req/res/next, no DB, no Express app): the six caller-by-required-role combinations from Verification, missing `req.user` gives `401` and `next()` is not called, the factory returns a function, and the middleware throws nothing and returns no promise.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and for `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint` on the two new files, were clean. The new test file passed 9/9, run with a throwaway config kept outside the repo that skips the Vitest `globalSetup`, because Docker was not running and `globalSetup` needs the `user_service_test` database. Mutation check: changing `>=` to `>` in `authorize.ts` made 2 tests fail; the source was restored afterwards. The rest of the suite was not re-run, since nothing existing was modified.

**Files:**

- `user-service/src/middleware/authorize.ts` (created)
- `user-service/tests/middleware/authorize.test.ts` (created)
- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified: Log index row)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- The full Vitest suite was not run against the database (Docker was not running); only the new DB-free test file was run.
- The instructions list `ROLE_RANK` as a plain `const` in the snippet but say to "Export a rank table"; it is exported.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 9: Admin Endpoints — View Users, Suspend/Unsuspend

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 9: Admin Endpoints — View Users, Suspend/Unsuspend" (design decisions table, `users.queries.ts` / `users.service.ts` / `users.controller.ts` / `users.routes.ts` specs, Verification bullets and "Tests (Vitest)" section), including the team's decisions recorded there: pending users listed and viewable with their `status`, `SUPER_ADMIN_IMMUTABLE` for any caller targeting a super admin, and `422 CANNOT_CHANGE_STATUS_PENDING_USER` for a status change on a pending user.

**Prompts (exact):**

> leave both as it is bah. finished my AI declaration already, can proceed to finish the git workflow, then start on stage 9

> sorry just merged my PR, proceed

> password_hash is removed by destructuring, not a field whitelist, so a column added later would show up in responses unless the service changes.
>
> - point me to the relevant code
>
> The pending rule returns "Cannot suspend pending user" even when the request was to set active, as specified.
>
> - can change to a generic "cannot change the status/role of pending/suspended user" (accordingly)

> can change the code as well (CANNOT*CHANGE_STATUS*...) you know the rest

**Key responses:**
Pulled `main` after the Stage 8 PR was merged and branched to `feat/stage-9-admin-users`. Implemented the three endpoints, all behind `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')` and mounted at `/users`:

- `users.queries.ts`: `listAllUsers` (every status, newest first) and `updateUserStatus` (`UPDATE ... RETURNING *`, run on the locked row).
- `users.service.ts` (new): `listUsers`, `getUserById` and `changeUserStatus`, each stripping `password_hash` before returning. `changeUserStatus` runs in `withTransaction` with `lockUserById` and checks, in order: not found (404), super admin target (403 `SUPER_ADMIN_IMMUTABLE`), admin caller on admin target (403 `FORBIDDEN`), pending target (422 `CANNOT_CHANGE_STATUS_PENDING_USER`), no-op (200, no write, no revocation). Suspending revokes all of the target's refresh tokens in the same transaction.
- `users.controller.ts` (new): Zod `.uuid('Invalid user ID')` on `req.params.id`, and a `.strict()` body schema for `status` with the specified custom messages.
- `users.routes.ts` (new) and the `/users` mount in `app.ts`.

Tests, all against the real test DB: users query tests (appended), `users.service.test.ts`, `users.controller.test.ts` (HTTP), `users.concurrency.test.ts`, and four deterministic re-check-after-lock cases (target promoted to super admin, turned pending, already suspended, or deleted while the request waited) appended to `lock-recheck.concurrency.test.ts`. A `createUserWithRole` / `accessTokenFor` / `bearer` fixture helper was added to `tests/helpers/fixtures.ts`. Every Stage 9 Verification bullet has a test.

Verification actually run: full suite 478 passed (19 files), `eslint .`, `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and for `tests/tsconfig.json`, and a build to a scratch directory were clean. Mutation checks: removing the revocation, the no-op check or the pending check each made 4 tests fail; removing `FOR UPDATE` from `lockUserById` made the lock tests fail (20 failures). Before the re-check tests were added, the looped concurrent-status test alone did NOT catch a missing row lock, which is why the deterministic tests were added. All mutated sources were restored and re-verified identical.

Environment: Docker Desktop was not running and was started. The existing `foc-user-db` container had been created before the `5434:5432` test port mapping existed, so it was recreated with `docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate user-db` (the `foc_user-db-data` volume was kept). Compose needed values for the other services' required variables, which were passed inline as dummy values for that one command; no `.env` file was created.

- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified: Log index row)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- `password_hash` is removed with a destructure and a one-line `eslint-disable` for the unused variable, rather than a field whitelist, so any column added later will appear in responses unless the service is changed.
- The pending-target rule applies whichever status is requested (`suspended` or `active`). At the team's request its message and code were made generic: `422 CANNOT_CHANGE_STATUS_PENDING_USER`, "Cannot change the status of a pending user" (previously `CANNOT_SUSPEND_PENDING_USER`). The Stage 10 rules in `instructions.md` were reworded the same way and are not implemented yet: `CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_PENDING_USER` / `CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_SUSPENDED_USER` (previously `CANNOT_PROMOTE_*`).
- Stage 9 makes `authenticate` a route dependency for the first time. Access tokens are stateless, so a suspended user's or demoted admin's existing access token keeps working on these routes for up to 15 minutes (the documented Stage 8 trade-off).

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Got Claude to help modify the error codes, to make it accurate (e.g. not just "suspend", but "change status").

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 10: Super Admin — Promote / Demote

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 10: Super Admin — Promote / Demote" (design decisions table, `updateUserRole` / `changeUserRole` / `changeRole` specs, Verification bullets and "Tests (Vitest)" section), including the team's recorded decisions there: only an `active` target's role can change (`422 CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_PENDING_USER` / `CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_SUSPENDED_USER`), and no-op requests return `200` unchanged.

**Prompts (exact):**

> go ahead. stop after opening the PR.

> let's go to 10.

**Key responses:**
Pulled `main` after the Stage 9 PR was merged and branched to `feat/stage-10-role-management`. Implemented `PUT /users/:id/role` behind `authenticate` + `authorize('super admin')`:

- `users.queries.ts`: `updateUserRole` (`UPDATE ... RETURNING *`, run on the locked row).
- `users.service.ts`: `changeUserRole(requesterId, targetId, newRole)`. Self-targeting is rejected first (403 `SELF_ROLE_CHANGE`, before any DB access). Then, in `withTransaction` with `lockUserById`: not found (404), super admin target (403 `SUPER_ADMIN_IMMUTABLE`), pending target (422 `CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_PENDING_USER`), suspended target (422 `CANNOT_CHANGE_ROLE_SUSPENDED_USER`), no-op (200, no write, no revocation). A real change updates the role and revokes all of the target's refresh tokens in the same transaction. `password_hash` is stripped by the existing `toPublicUser`.
- `users.controller.ts`: `changeRole`, with the Stage 9 `.uuid('Invalid user ID')` params schema and a `.strict()` body schema for `role` with the specified custom messages; the requester id comes from `req.user.user_id`.
- `users.routes.ts`: the `/:id/role` route.

Tests, all against the real test DB, appended to the Stage 9 test files: `updateUserRole` query tests; `changeUserRole` service tests; HTTP tests for `PUT /users/:id/role`; a concurrent-role test in `users.concurrency.test.ts`; and five deterministic re-check-after-lock cases in `lock-recheck.concurrency.test.ts` (target became super admin, suspended, pending, already had the role, or was deleted while the request waited). Every Stage 10 Verification bullet has a test except the one listed under Deviations.

Verification actually run: full suite 524 passed (19 files), `eslint .`, `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and for `tests/tsconfig.json`, and a build to a scratch directory were clean. Mutation checks on `changeUserRole`: removing the token revocation failed 9 tests, the no-op check 8, the suspended check 5 and the self-target check 4; the source was restored and verified identical. The first run of the concurrency test failed on a test-fixture mistake (a hyphen in a generated username, which registration rejects) and was fixed in the test only. The `foc-user-db` container from Stage 9 was still running.

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- **One Verification bullet was not written as a test because the spec contradicts itself.** The bullet "Promote a user to admin, then that user's pre-promotion access token ... still rejected with `403` ...; after they `refresh`, the new token carries `role: admin` and the same route succeeds" cannot hold as written: a successful role change revokes ALL of the target's refresh tokens in the same transaction (Stage 10 design table), so `POST /auth/refresh` with the pre-promotion cookie returns `401 INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN`, exactly as the demotion bullet says. The first half of the bullet (old token still gets `403`) is tested, and so is "refresh with the old cookie gets `401`" after a promotion. What the promoted user does to get a token carrying `role: admin` (for example, logging in again) is not specified, so no test asserts it. Raised for the team rather than guessed.
- The Stage 8 note that "enforcement catches up at the next `refresh` call" has the same tension for promotions, since the refresh is revoked.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 11: Requester/Courier Toggle

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 11: Requester/Courier Toggle" (design decisions table, `init.sql`, `updateActiveView` / `changeActiveView` / `updateActiveView` controller and route specs, the `login` change and Verification bullets). The section is in the team's working copy of `instructions.md` and is committed with this change.

**Prompts (exact):**

> before you start anything, go to a new branch from main.
> after you PR, wait for further instructions.
>
> go ahed and do 11

> yes, it should be 403 and 400 for regular user and admin respectively. whwat changes are needed?

> 1. go ahead and make the change
> 2. is everything else standardised to using underscores?

> let's go to snake caes then

**Key responses:**
Pulled `main` (Stage 10 already merged) and branched to `feat/stage-11-active-view`. Implemented `PUT /users/me/active-view` behind `authenticate` only:

- `init.sql`: `active_view_enum` (`requester`, `courier`) with the same safe-creation pattern as the other enums, and `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS active_view ... NOT NULL DEFAULT 'requester'`.
- `users.queries.ts`: `active_view` added to `UserRow`; `updateActiveView` (`UPDATE ... RETURNING *`, returns `null` when no row).
- `me.service.ts`: `changeActiveView(userId, activeView)`, a plain single-row update with no lock or transaction; `404 USER_NOT_FOUND` if no row; `password_hash` stripped. `toPublicUser` in `users.service.ts` was exported for reuse.
- `me.controller.ts`: `updateActiveView` with a `.strict()` Zod body schema and the specified messages; the user id comes only from `req.user.user_id`.
- `me.routes.ts`, and `app.ts` mounts `meRouter` at `/users/me` before `usersRouter`.
- `auth.service.ts`: `login` returns `activeView` in the `user` object, read from the row already locked in the login transaction.

No new test cases were added (the stage has no Tests section and the standing rule is not to add tests unless asked). Four existing tests asserted exact key sets and were updated for the new field: the two `login` user-object assertions (`auth.service.test.ts`, `auth.controller.test.ts`) and the two `listUsers` key lists (`users.service.test.ts`, `users.controller.test.ts`).

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and for `tests/tsconfig.json` and `eslint .` were clean. The full suite passed 524 of 524 on the final run. Two earlier full runs each had one different test fail, once with a register-normalisation assertion and once with an `ECONNRESET` in a supertest call; neither reproduced on the next run, and they were not investigated further. A throwaway supertest script (deleted afterwards, not committed) exercised the Stage 11 bullets against the test DB: `courier` returns 200 and updates the column, the same value again returns 200, no header returns 401, a bad enum, missing field, wrong type and extra field return 400, login returns `activeView`, and three concurrent calls all returned 200.

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- **`/users/me` check, resolved.** The Verification bullet originally expected `404` for a request to `/users/me`. Raised with the team: `meRouter` has no `GET` route, so `GET /users/me` always falls through to `usersRouter`'s `GET /:id` with `id = 'me'`, regardless of mount order — a regular user gets `403 FORBIDDEN` from `authorize('admin')`, an admin gets `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` (`"Invalid user ID"`) from the UUID check. The team confirmed 403/400 is correct and reworded the bullet in `instructions.md` accordingly; no code change was needed. The mount order itself was already correct, since it only needs to route `PUT /users/me/active-view` to `meRouter` first.
- **Response key name, resolved.** `PUT /users/me/active-view`'s response returns `active_view` (the same "DB row minus `password_hash`" shape as `GET /users/:id`), not `activeView` as the Verification bullet's original example showed. Raised with the team, who confirmed snake_case, matching the rest of the `/users` family; `login`'s `activeView` stays the deliberate one-off named explicitly by the Stage 11 spec. `instructions.md` was reworded to match; no code change was needed.
- `init.sql` only applies to a fresh DB volume. The dev database needs `docker compose down -v` (dev data only) or a manual `ALTER TABLE` (with `CREATE TYPE active_view_enum` first) against the running container. The test DB is recreated from `init.sql` on each run, so it is unaffected.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 11b: Test Suite — Requester/Courier Toggle

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code (tests)
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 11b: Test Suite — Requester/Courier Toggle" (scope, ground rules inherited from Stage 7, "What to test" list, and "One thing NOT to test here"), plus the user's resolution of two points raised before writing anything: the concurrent-toggle case goes in `tests/concurrency/`, consistent with Stages 9-10, despite Stage 11b's Deliverables section naming only controller/service files; and the `tests/TRACEABILITY.md` deliverable is skipped (the file was never created in Stage 7 and updating it is out of scope here).

**Prompts (exact):**

> right, is the code from stage 11 pulled in also?

> is 11b clear?

> 1. consistent with all the previous stages
> 2. ignore the TRACEABILITY part

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-11b-active-view-tests` from `main` (which already had Stage 11 merged). Wrote the Stage 11 test suite, following Stage 7's ground rules, real-Postgres approach and layout:

- `tests/services/me.service.test.ts`: `changeActiveView` toggling to `courier` and back to `requester`, the "same value it already has" case returning normally (no no-op branch exists), the full response shape (snake_case, `password_hash` stripped), and `404 USER_NOT_FOUND` for a nonexistent id.
- `tests/controllers/me.controller.test.ts`: HTTP tests for `PUT /users/me/active-view` — the two successful toggles, the same-value case, no-`Authorization` 401, the three body-validation 400s (invalid enum, missing field, wrong type) and the extra-field 400, a newly-activated user defaulting to `requester`, and `POST /auth/login`'s response carrying the current `activeView`.
- `tests/concurrency/me.concurrency.test.ts`: concurrent `PUT /users/me/active-view` calls with different values on the same user, over `LOOP_ITERATIONS` iterations of `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` requests each (the suite's existing shared constants) — asserts no `500`, all `200`, and a valid final value, since there is no lock here to serialize on.

Per Stage 11b's explicit carve-out, no test asserts `GET /users/me`'s current fallthrough to `usersRouter`'s `GET /:id` — that's a known, temporary gap Stage 12 closes.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `tests/tsconfig.json` and `eslint .` were clean. The full suite passed 540 of 540 on a clean run. One run had a single unrelated failure in the pre-existing `tests/concurrency/races.concurrency.test.ts` (a Stage 7 file, not touched here); it passed both alone and on the next full run, so it was treated as a timing flake and not investigated further.

**Files:**

- `user-service/tests/services/me.service.test.ts` (created)
- `user-service/tests/controllers/me.controller.test.ts` (created)
- `user-service/tests/concurrency/me.concurrency.test.ts` (created)
- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified: Log index row)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**

- Two points were raised and resolved before writing any tests (see Governing decision and Prompts above): concurrency-test placement, and skipping `TRACEABILITY.md`. Both are recorded above rather than decided unilaterally.
- No implementation code was changed to make a test pass; all tests passed against the existing Stage 11 code.

**What I kept/changed/rejected:**
Accepted all changes.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 12a: GET /users/me

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 12: Profile Management" design-decisions table (`GET /users/me` response row) and "Stage 12a: `GET /users/me`" section (`getOwnProfile`, `getProfile`, route, Verification bullets).

**Prompts (exact):**

> read through instructions.md and the code base and understand what's going on. you will be implementing stage 12. don't do any coding first.

> you know the git workflow?

> right after the PR, pause first, let me merge the PR, then you move on to the next stage.
>
> yes, let's split by sub-stage.

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-12a-get-profile` from `main` (up to date, `instructions.md`'s Stage 12 section already committed at `c1779ee`). Implemented exactly the 12a spec:

- `me.service.ts`: `getOwnProfile(userId)` — `findById`, `404 USER_NOT_FOUND` if none, returns `{ username, email }` only (not the `toPublicUser` shape used by `changeActiveView`).
- `me.controller.ts`: `getProfile`, `asyncHandler`, no request body, calls `meService.getOwnProfile(req.user!.user_id)`, returns `200` with the object directly.
- `me.routes.ts`: `router.get('/', authenticate, meController.getProfile)`, added above the existing `active-view` route.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and for `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint .`, all clean. While verifying manually against the running container, found the container's image predated the Stage 7 fix that moved the server entry point to `server.ts` — the on-disk `package.json`/`Dockerfile` were already correct, but the image hadn't been rebuilt since, so it was running `tsx src/app.ts` (which only exports the app and never calls `.listen()`), silently exiting with code 0 on every reload. Rebuilt with `docker compose build user-service && docker compose up -d user-service`, which fixed it; not a Stage 12 code change. Root `.env` was also missing `CREDIT_DB_*`/other newer variables compose now interpolates (added from `.env.example`'s defaults, local-only, gitignored, not committed) so `docker compose` commands would run at all. Logged in as the seeded super admin and confirmed: `GET /users/me` with a valid token → `200 {"username":"superadmin","email":"superadmin@foc.com"}`, no other fields; without an `Authorization` header → `401 {"code":"UNAUTHORIZED"}`. Also noticed `POST /auth/login`'s response is missing `activeView` in this dev DB — traced to the same known gap already logged in Stage 11 (`active_view` column never migrated into the persistent dev volume, since `init.sql` only runs on a fresh one); unrelated to Stage 12a and not changed here.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 12b: Change Username

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 12: Profile Management" design-decisions table (username-change rows) and "Stage 12b: Change Username" section (`updateUsername`, `changeUsername`, controller, route, Verification bullets).

**Prompts (exact):**

> go ahead

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-12b-change-username` from `main` (up to date, Stage 12a merged). Implemented exactly the 12b spec:

- `users.queries.ts`: `updateUsername(userId, username, db)` — `UPDATE ... SET username = $2, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *`.
- `auth.service.ts`: exported `USERNAME_REGEX`, `EMAIL_REGEX`, `PASSWORD_REGEX`, and a new `USERNAME_MESSAGE` constant (previously an inline string in `register`), so `me.service.ts` can reuse the exact registration format rule/message per the spec ("Same format rule as registration") instead of duplicating it; `register`'s behavior is unchanged, it now reads the same constant. `EMAIL_REGEX` was also exported ahead of Stage 12c, which needs it for the same reason.
- `me.service.ts`: `changeUsername(userId, newUsername)` — format check against `USERNAME_REGEX`, then inside `withTransaction`: `lockUserById` (404 if none), same-as-current check (409 `USERNAME_UNCHANGED`), `findByUsername` taken-by-another check (409 `USERNAME_TAKEN`), `updateUsername` wrapped in try/catch for Postgres `23505` mapped to the same `USERNAME_TAKEN` (covers the concurrent race), returns `{ username, email }`.
- `me.controller.ts`: `changeUsername`, `.strict()` Zod schema with `newUsername` lowercased-only (not trimmed) and this endpoint's own required/type messages ("New username is required"/"New username must be a string") — distinct from `auth.controller.ts`'s `usernameField`, which has registration's own messages; the spec calls for the same normalisation but endpoint-specific text, unlike Stage 12c's `newEmail` which the spec says to build directly from the shared `emailField`.
- `me.routes.ts`: `router.put('/username', authenticate, meController.changeUsername)`.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint .`, all clean. Manually verified against the rebuilt container (still healthy from Stage 12a) with the seeded super admin and a freshly registered second user (`testuser99`): same-username → `409 USERNAME_UNCHANGED`; valid rename → `200`, confirmed via a follow-up `GET /users/me` and reverted afterward; missing field → `400` "New username is required"; wrong type → `400` "New username must be a string"; extra field → `400` "Request contains unexpected fields"; too-short and spaced usernames → `400` with the registration format message; no `Authorization` header → `401`; second account attempting the first account's username → `409 USERNAME_TAKEN`; two concurrent `PUT /users/me/username` calls from the two accounts targeting the same new, unused username → exactly one `200`, the other `409 USERNAME_TAKEN`, no `500`s (exercises the `23505` catch path).

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 12c: Change Email — Initiate

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 12: Profile Management" design-decisions table (email-change rows: purpose, one-step flow, old-email-authoritative-until-verified) and "Stage 12c: Change Email — Initiate" section (`initiateEmailChange`, controller, route, Verification bullets).

**Prompts (exact):**

> go for it

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-12c-change-email-initiate` from `main` (up to date, Stage 12b merged). Implemented exactly the 12c spec:

- `email.service.ts`: added a `Change Email` entry to `PURPOSE_COPY` — subject "Confirm your new FoC email address", same body shape as the other two templates.
- `me.service.ts`: `initiateEmailChange(userId, { currentPassword, newEmail })` — format check against `EMAIL_REGEX` (now exported from `auth.service.ts`, same as `USERNAME_REGEX` in Stage 12b), unlocked `findById` + `bcrypt.compare` (bcrypt is slow, verified before locking), `EMAIL_UNCHANGED`/`EMAIL_TAKEN` checks, then inside `withTransaction`: `lockUserById`, re-verify the password against the locked row, re-check `EMAIL_UNCHANGED`/`EMAIL_TAKEN` against the locked row and a fresh `findByEmail` (closes the gap between the unlocked read and the lock), then `requestOtp({ purpose: 'Change Email', newEmail }, client)` with the exact same result mapping `forgotPassword` uses (`sent` success, `throttled` → `429` cooldown/limit, `no-user`/`not-verified` handled for exhaustiveness though unreachable here); `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` propagates as `503` automatically since `issueOtp` throws it directly.
- `auth.controller.ts`: exported the existing `emailField` (previously module-private) so `me.controller.ts` can reuse it verbatim, per the spec's "`newEmail` uses the shared `emailField`" — unlike Stage 12b's `newUsername`, which the spec gave its own distinct messages for.
- `me.controller.ts`: `changeEmail`, `.strict()` Zod schema (`currentPassword` required/string, `newEmail` = shared `emailField`), returns `200 OTP_SENT`.
- `me.routes.ts`: `router.put('/email', authenticate, meController.changeEmail)`.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint .`, all clean. Manually verified against the live container with the seeded super admin: correct password + valid unused new email → `200 OTP_SENT`, confirmed a `users_otps` row with `purpose = 'Change Email'` and `new_email` set, and the OTP itself in the dev-fallback console log; wrong current password → `401 INVALID_PASSWORD`; new email same as current → `409 EMAIL_UNCHANGED`; new email already registered (`testuser99@example.com`) → `409 EMAIL_TAKEN`; immediate repeat → `429 OTP_RESEND_COOLDOWN` with a `Retry-After` header; six requests with OTP rows backdated between each (to clear the cooldown) → the sixth returned `429 OTP_RESEND_LIMIT`, "Maximum OTP resends reached. Please try again in about an hour."; malformed email → `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`; missing `currentPassword` → `400` "Current password is required"; extra field → `400` "Request contains unexpected fields"; no `Authorization` header → `401`. Did not force an SMTP failure to check `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` → `503` directly (would need reconfiguring and restarting the container); that code path is unchanged from `forgotPassword`, which already exercises it. Test `users_otps` rows were deleted afterward and the super admin's email was confirmed unchanged.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 12d: /users/me/verify-otp and /users/me/resend-otp

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 12: Profile Management" design-decisions table (route split for OTP endpoints, why password-change has no verify-otp entry, resending a change-email OTP) and "Stage 12d" section (`updateEmail`, `verifyEmailChangeOtp`, `resendChangeEmailOtp`, `resendChangePasswordOtp`, controllers, routes, Verification bullets).

**Prompts (exact):**

> go

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-12d-me-otp-routes` from `main` (up to date, Stage 12c merged; also picked up an unrelated order-service change from a teammate's earlier merge). Implemented exactly the 12d spec:

- `users.queries.ts`: `updateEmail(userId, email, db)` — `UPDATE ... SET email = $2, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *`.
- `me.service.ts`: `verifyEmailChangeOtp(userId, otp)` — locks the user row, reads the pending `Change Email` OTP row for its `new_email`, calls the existing `checkOtp` (default consuming), and on a correct guess calls `updateEmail` wrapped in try/catch for Postgres `23505` mapped to `409 EMAIL_TAKEN` — per the spec, that throw propagates out of `withTransaction` and rolls back the whole transaction including the OTP consumption, so the OTP stays usable for a different email (verified manually, see below). `resendChangeEmailOtp` and `resendChangePasswordOtp` each lock the user, require an unconsumed pending OTP row for their purpose (else `400 NO_PENDING_EMAIL_CHANGE`/`NO_PENDING_PASSWORD_CHANGE`), then call `requestOtp` with the same cooldown/limit/sent mapping as Stage 12c. Factored that mapping (previously inlined once in `initiateEmailChange`) into a shared `throwOnUnsentOtp` helper now used by all three call sites, since Stage 12d needed the identical block twice more — a same-file DRY refactor, no behavior change, covered by the same manual re-verification of Stage 12c's cases below.
- `me.controller.ts`: `verifyOtp` — `.strict()` Zod schema, `purpose` enum `['change_email']` only ("Invalid purpose" otherwise per the spec), returns `200 EMAIL_CHANGE_SUCCESS`. `resendOtp` — `purpose` enum `['change_email', 'change_password']`, dispatches to the matching service function, returns `200 OTP_SENT`. Both read the user id only from `req.user.user_id`; neither schema accepts an `email` field. A local `mePurposeErrorMap`/schema pair, kept separate from `auth.controller.ts`'s public `/auth/verify-otp`/`/auth/resend-otp` purpose sets, per the spec's explicit "the two purpose sets stay separate."
- `me.routes.ts`: `router.post('/verify-otp', authenticate, meController.verifyOtp)` and `router.post('/resend-otp', authenticate, meController.resendOtp)`.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint .`, all clean. Manually verified against the live container with the seeded super admin (and, for the race case, a second freshly-registered account): full initiate → verify happy path (`200 EMAIL_CHANGE_SUCCESS`, email updated, reverted afterward); wrong purpose on `/users/me/verify-otp` → `400` "Invalid purpose"; wrong OTP → `400 INVALID_OTP`; 5 wrong attempts then a 6th → `429 OTP_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED`, email unchanged; OTP with `expires_at` backdated → `400 OTP_EXPIRED`; resend for `change_email` → `200 OTP_SENT`, confirmed in the DB that the new row carries the same `new_email` and the old row's `consumed_at` is now set; resend with no pending change, for both `change_email` and `change_password` → `400 NO_PENDING_EMAIL_CHANGE`/`NO_PENDING_PASSWORD_CHANGE`; both routes with no `Authorization` header → `401`; the public `/auth/verify-otp` and `/auth/resend-otp` both still reject `change_email`/`change_password` as an invalid purpose, confirming the two purpose sets stayed separate; and the specified race — registered a second account that took superadmin's pending `new_email` first, then superadmin submitted the correct OTP → `409 EMAIL_TAKEN`, and a DB check confirmed the OTP row's `consumed_at` was still null (the transaction rollback restored it) and superadmin's email was unchanged. Testing needed the DB cooldown/created_at backdated a few times (the same OTP-resend cooldown from Stage 12c applies to every initiate/resend on this purpose) — noted here since it is not itself a Stage 12d behavior, just a side effect of reusing the same superadmin account across sub-stage testing. Test OTP rows and the decoy registered account were left in the dev DB afterward, matching how earlier stages left their test accounts (`testuser99`, etc.) in place.

## 2026-09-27 — Stage 12e: Change Password — Initiate + Confirm

**Tool:** Claude Code (model: claude-sonnet-5)
**Mode:** generate
**Scope:** Implementation code
**Governing decision:** `instructions.md` "Stage 12: Profile Management" design-decisions table (password-change flow: two calls, nothing pending stored server-side; new-password validation; password re-entry check pattern; successful-change side effect) and "Stage 12e: Change Password — Initiate + Confirm" section (`initiatePasswordChange`, `confirmPasswordChange`, controllers, routes, Verification bullets). This completes Stage 12.

**Prompts (exact):**

> let's go with e

**Key responses:**
Branched `feat/stage-12e-change-password` from `main` (up to date, Stage 12d merged). Implemented exactly the 12e spec:

- `auth.service.ts`: exported the existing `OTP_REGEX` (previously module-private), alongside the already-exported `PASSWORD_REGEX`/`PASSWORD_MESSAGE`, for reuse in `me.service.ts` — no behavior change.
- `me.service.ts`: `initiatePasswordChange(userId, { currentPassword, newPassword })` — `newPassword` complexity check, unlocked `findById` + `bcrypt.compare` for the current password (bcrypt is slow, verified before locking) and for same-as-current (`400 PASSWORD_UNCHANGED`), then inside `withTransaction`: `lockUserById`, re-verify the current password against the locked row, `requestOtp({ purpose: 'Change Password' }, client)` using the same `throwOnUnsentOtp` helper Stage 12d factored out. `newPassword` is validated but never persisted here, exactly as the spec states. `confirmPasswordChange(userId, { otp, newPassword })` — `newPassword` complexity and `OTP_REGEX` format checks, then inside `withTransaction`: `lockUserById`, re-check same-as-current against the freshly locked row (spec: "in case the password changed between initiate and confirm"), `checkOtp` (default consuming), and on `{ ok: true }` hashes the new password, `updatePasswordHash`, and `revokeAllRefreshTokensForUser` in the same transaction; on `{ ok: false }`, throws `400 INVALID_OTP` after the transaction commits (same pattern as `resetPassword` in `auth.service.ts`, so the incremented attempt count persists).
- `me.controller.ts`: `changePassword` (`PUT /users/me/password`) and `confirmPasswordChange` (`POST /users/me/confirm-password-change`), both `.strict()` Zod schemas with required/string messages matching `resetPasswordSchema`'s style (`currentPassword` follows the "Current password is required" style Stage 12c introduced). Returns match the spec's exact message/code pairs.
- `me.routes.ts`: `router.put('/password', authenticate, meController.changePassword)` and `router.post('/confirm-password-change', authenticate, meController.confirmPasswordChange)`.

Verification actually run: `tsc --noEmit` for `src` and `tests/tsconfig.json`, and `eslint .`, all clean. Manually verified end-to-end against the live container using a freshly registered test account (`pwtest1`, not the seeded super admin, to avoid any risk to the shared dev credentials): wrong current password at initiate → `401 INVALID_PASSWORD`; same-as-current `newPassword` at initiate → `400 PASSWORD_UNCHANGED`; weak `newPassword` at either step → `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`; happy path → `200 OTP_SENT` then `200 PASSWORD_CHANGE_SUCCESS`; login with the new password → `200`, with the old password → `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; confirmed in the DB that the pre-change refresh tokens were revoked while a token issued by the post-change login stayed valid; wrong OTP → `400 INVALID_OTP`; 5 wrong attempts then a 6th → `429 OTP_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED`, password unchanged; OTP with `expires_at` backdated → `400 OTP_EXPIRED`; re-submitting an already-consumed OTP with a fresh `newPassword` (to isolate it from the `PASSWORD_UNCHANGED` check) → `400 INVALID_OTP`; confirming with a different `newPassword` than what was sent to initiate → succeeded with the confirm-step value, login with it worked, confirming initiate's validation is advisory only, per the spec's explicit note that this is intended; no `Authorization` header on either route → `401`; two concurrent `confirm-password-change` calls with the same correct OTP → exactly one `200`, the other `400`, password changed exactly once, no `500`s — run twice: with an identical `newPassword` in both requests, the loser got `400 PASSWORD_UNCHANGED` (its own pre-lock validation ran against the row after the winner's commit already matched it) rather than the `INVALID_OTP` the Verification bullet's wording assumes; with two different `newPassword` values, the loser did get `400 INVALID_OTP` as literally stated. Both are correct, non-`500`, exactly-once-success outcomes and a direct, spec-ordered consequence (the same-as-current check runs before `checkOtp`), not a bug — noted here rather than treated as a deviation.

## 2026-09-28 — frontend: Create product frontend from mockup

**Tool:** GitHub Copilot
**Mode:** generate, refactor, docs
**Scope:** Implementation code, Boilerplate, Refactor/Docs
**Governing decision:** User request in chat; existing mockup stack and existing Compose conventions.

**Prompts (exact):**

> I want to turn our existing `foc-mockup/` into the starting point for the actual frontend. First, inspect the repo and understand the existing frontend, backend, Docker/Compose setup, and the structure of `foc-mockup/`. Keep `foc-mockup/`, create a new `frontend/`, remove dummy data from the real frontend, connect to existing APIs or clearly document missing backend APIs, add frontend Docker/Compose setup, keep original mockup AI notes, create `frontend/AI_NOTES.md`, verify frontend and Compose.

**Key responses:**
Inspected the mockup, backend routes, Dockerfiles, Compose files, and repository AI policy. Created `frontend/` using the existing Vite/React/Tailwind stack, reused the mockup stylesheet, logo, and button, and connected only to the existing `GET /orders` endpoint. Demo supplier, request, user, wallet, transaction, and message data was not copied. Added explicit documentation for backend gaps, a production nginx image, a development image, and Compose services. `npm install && npm run build` passed; `docker compose config --quiet` passed. The first build command was run from the repository root and failed because there is no root package.json; it was rerun from `frontend/` successfully.

**Files:**

- `frontend/` (created)
- `compose.yaml` (modified)
- `compose.dev.yaml` (modified)
- `README.md` (modified: Log index row)
- `ai/usage-log.md` (modified)

**Deviations / questions raised for the team:**
No API routes or backend contracts were invented. Supplier, auth, credit balance/transactions, and order mutation APIs remain needed before those product flows can be connected.

## 2026-09-28 — frontend: Fix Compose Watch frontend port mapping

**Tool:** GitHub Copilot

**Key responses:**
Reproduced the exact command and found that the merged dev configuration inherited both `5173:80` and `5173:5173`, leaving the frontend without a usable host binding. Changed the dev override to replace the production port list, leaving only `5173:5173`, then restarted Compose Watch. The frontend now publishes `0.0.0.0:5173->5173/tcp` and returns HTTP 200.
